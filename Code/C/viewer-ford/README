This is the README for the source code accompanying the Ford Vision and Laser dataset, which
is a modified version of the source code available with MIT DARPA Grand Challenge dataset.

1. Directory Layout
===================

There are 3 top-level directories:
 
c/

    Contains C source code and examples for parsing the LCM log files,
    extracting data, and using the sensor calibrations.  

lcmtypes/

    Contains the LCM type definitions that are officially supported in this
    dataset.

linux-viewer/

    Contains a Linux-specific application for visualizing logged data in a
    common coordinate frame.

Additionally, there is a file "ford.cfg" that contains the sensor calibration
data and other physical characteristics of the Ford F-250 pickup truck.

2. Parsing the data files
=========================

The following C programs demonstrate how to extract information from the log
files:

  c/example1-applanix-poses.c  Extract the locally integrated and filtered vehicle
                               pose coming from applanix (high cost professional IMU)
  c/example2-mtig-poses.c      Extract the raw data coming from MTIG (low cost consumer IMU)
  c/example3-gps.c             Extract the vehicle GPS pose.
  c/example4-riegl.c           Extract Riegl laser range and intensity data.


A Makefile is provided for these example programs, and requires GCC.  The
examples do not require any external/3rd-party libraries.

In addition to the example programs, the following files contain potentially
useful data structures and algorithms:

  c/config.h             Parsing and extracting information from the
                         configuration file (i.e., calibration parameters)
  c/camtrans.h           Project and un-project points and rays between a 
                         camera's pixel space and the vehicle body frame
  c/small_linalg.h       Simple linear algebra routines
  c/rotations.h          Routines for working with rotations
  c/velodyne.h           Routines for parsing raw Velodyne data

  c/eventlog.h                   Read/write the raw data packets in a log file
  c/lcmtypes_pose_t.h            Data structure for a logged pose estimate
  c/lcmtypes_mtig_t.h            Data structure for a data from mtig (consumer grade IMU)
  c/lcmtypes_laser_t.h           Data structure for a logged RIEGL scan

The data files are stored using the LCM log file format, described below.  The
LCM libraries and tools can also be used to parse and work with the data files
from Java, Python, and MATLAB, in addition to C.  See the LCM website for more
information.

3. Using the Linux viewer
=========================

See the linux-viewer/README file for information on how to compile and use the
data visualization application.


4.  LCM log file format
========================

This section describes the log file format.  

It is not necessary to read this section to extract data from the log files, as
the files c/eventlog.c and c/eventlog.h implement this functionality.

Conceptually, an LCM Log file is an ordered list of events. Each event has four
fields:

1. event number    
   monotonically increasing 64-bit integer that identifies each event. It
   should start at zero, and increase in increments of one.  
2. timestamp
   monotonically increasing 64-bit integer that identifies the number of
   microseconds since the epoch (00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970) at which the
   event was received.
3. channel     
   UTF-8 string identifying the LCM channel on which the message was received.
4. data    
   binary blob consisting of the exact message received. 

Each event is encoded as a binary structure consisting of a header, followed by
the channel and the data.

The header is 28 bytes and has the following format:

 0      7 8     15 16    23 24    31 
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|   LCM Sync Word                   |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|   Event Number (upper 32 bits)    |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|   Event Number (lower 32 bits)    |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|   Timestamp (upper 32 bits)       |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|   Timestamp (lower 32 bits)       |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|   Channel Length                  |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|   Data Length                     |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+

LCM Sync Word is an unsigned 32-bit integer with value 0xEDA1DA01

Event Number and Timestamp fields of the header are as described above.

Channel Length field is an unsigned 32-bit integer describing the length of the
channel name.

Data Length field is an unsigned 32-bit integer describing the length of the
data.

Each header is immediately followed by the UTF-8 encoding of the LCM channel,
and then the message data. The channel is not NULL-terminated.

All integers are packed in network order (big endian)
